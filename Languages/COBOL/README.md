# Cobol
This repository contains exercises developed in the COBOL course with Professor Hiromasa Nagata at Fatec-SP, as well as self-authored exercises. The objective is to train and develop skills and proficiency in the language, through exercises that cover topics such as control structures, file manipulation, and data processing.
